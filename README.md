# Clustering
#With DBScan it becomes much clear that a lot of data entries are actually noise, but in Hierarchical(Agglomerative) and K-Means they were forcefully assigned to some cluster because both algorithms provide user with the choice of selecting the number of clusters whereas DBScan does not do that directly and asks for Eps and MinPts
